This is a project I made while going through an online web development course in my own time to supplement my learning in addition to my time studying full stack development with Mission Ready. 

It allows you to sign-up for an account and submit an online image URL of a personâ€™s face, which an external API will detect and outline on top of the submitted photo. The application tracks how many times each registered user has used the face detection feature.

The technologies used are React JS for the frontend, Express/ Node JS for the backend, as well as a SQL database. The face detection portion of the application is using the Clarifai API.
